I refactored my assignment significant since the first HW. Originally, I had a public Pair class, which was not a great method for information-hiding. I have since made that class private inside of the classes that need the functionality so that they aren't dependent on an external class's functionality. In addition, all of the file management is done inside the input and main classes now. That was an unnecessary class. In addition, since paths are provided in the config file now, there does not need to be a dynamic path checking class like I had before, so I removed that and made try/catch statements to let the user know if the path works inside of that config file. Other than that, I cleaned up as much as I could, organized functionality so each class actually does what it says, and hopefully this is a lot better.

To run the program, make sure the jar, config.properties, and test input files are in the same directory, and run the jar file via the command line.
